# GitHub CLI / API Notes For `babysit-pr`

The watcher uses polling through `gh`; GitHub does not provide a general PR WebSocket/GraphQL subscription API. GitHub webhooks are the push-based option, but they require an external receiver and repo configuration, so this skill defaults to local polling.

`--watch` is event-gated: it polls silently, emits one compact JSON event when useful state changes (or heartbeat/terminal state), then exits. Cross-invocation state is carried by the returned opaque `cursor`, not by an external JSON state file.

## Primary commands used

### PR metadata

- `gh pr view --json number,url,state,mergedAt,closedAt,headRefName,headRefOid,headRepository,headRepositoryOwner`

Used to resolve PR number, URL, branch, head SHA, and closed/merged state.

### PR checks summary

- `gh pr checks --json name,state,bucket,link,workflow,event,startedAt,completedAt`

Used to compute pending/failed/passed counts and whether the current CI round is terminal.

### Workflow runs for head SHA

- `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs -X GET -f head_sha=<sha> -f per_page=100`

Used to discover failed workflow runs and rerunnable run IDs.

### Failed log inspection

- `gh run view <run-id> --json jobs,name,workflowName,conclusion,status,url,headSha`
- `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`

Used by AI agents to classify branch-related vs flaky/unrelated failures.

### Retry failed jobs only

- `gh run rerun <run-id> --failed`

Reruns only failed jobs (and dependencies) for a workflow run.
